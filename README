KCms is an highly configurable, totally OOP and theme based cms.

For install it, upload the files in your web space, and go to install.php.

Now you can log in going to login.php file.

Next you'll redirect to admin.php, here you can modify, delete and add new page.


For add a new theme you'll put the css file in /themes directory and change your "$theme" variable in settings.php to your css name without the extension.

Enjoy it!
